      " 'business intelligence.\\n'\n",
      " '\\n'\n",
      " '**Challenges and Incomplete Knowledge**:\\n'\n",
      " 'Traditional entity matching algorithms often rely on exact or near-exact '\n",
      " 'string matching rules. However, in real-world scenarios, records may contain '\n",
      " 'incomplete or noisy information, making exact matching insufficient. For '\n",
      " \"example, an address might be missing a street number or a person's name \"\n",

      " 'Google Gemini AI addresses these challenges by leveraging machine learning '\n",
      " 'techniques to train a model that can perform entity matching even with '\n",
      " 'incomplete knowledge. Gemini AI utilizes a generative adversarial network '\n",
      " '(GAN) architecture, where two neural networks, a generator and a '\n",

      " '**Generator Network**:\\n'\n",
      " 'The generator network aims to generate plausible entity pairs that represent '\n",

      " '\\n'\n",
      " '**Adversarial Training**:\\n'\n",
      " 'The generator and discriminator networks are trained in an adversarial '\n",
      " 'fashion, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator by generating '\n",
      " 'more realistic entity pairs, while the discriminator attempts to accurately '\n",
